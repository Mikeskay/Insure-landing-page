# Task Title: Insure landing page

# Task Description:

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  I could use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. 

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. I will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to, however, there is no  optimised tablet version
